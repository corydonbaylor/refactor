    <p>&quot;No, you keep. Carry.&quot; </p>
    <p>I had left the bag for my new Seiko watch in the bathrooms outside the Imperial Palace. I realized but within 15 minutes of discovering my mistake, the janitor had already cleaned the bathroom and thrown the bag and box into the trash. </p>
    <p>I had entered the bathroom and had asked if he had seen a watch box in there&mdash; partly because I was embarrassed about leaving what was essentially garbage by the sink in the bathroom, but mostly to retrieve the warranty card from the bag.</p>
    <p>He gestured to his garbage bag, and I fished both out, the box was covered in a thin layer of garbage bag moisture, but the warranty card was tucked into an envelope and free of the liquid. </p>
    <p>I took the box out of the bathroom, and then asked the janitor if he could take it. </p>
    <p>&quot;No you keep. Carry&quot;, he said hold both his hands up and bowing slightly. </p>
    <p>The Japanese have a weird thing about trash. It&#39;s a private responsibility, and the world&#39;s biggest city is largest spotless because of it. </p>
    <p>I don&#39;t think it&#39;s as simple as to say that the Japanese are just better about trash. There, people don&#39;t walk and eat. If they get a sandwich at 7/11, they eat it there or take it home and eat it. You will not see them walking around the streets or subways with food or drinks in their hands, and thus don&#39;t need to throw anything away in a public trashcan. </p>
    <p>And neither will you see them with a plastic bag containing all of the day&#39;s wrappers, pamphlets and tickets. Whatever institution gave them the offending piece of detritus is typically responsible for disposing of that detritus. </p>
    <p>The tourist naturally has a much different consumption pattern. We are spending 90% of our waking hours walking from sight to sight, eating little snacks from convenience stores and being forcibly handed temple tickets that no one checks and pamphlets that are too dry to read. And by the end of the day, our pockets are full of trash, and there really is no where to put them.</p>
    <p>It wasn&#39;t always this way. There actually used to be public trash cans. In 1995, a religious cult released sarin gas from public trash can throughout the Tokyo subway, killing 13 and injuring over 5,000. The government responded by removing nearly all public waste receptacles, and here we are today.</p>
    <p>This is not to say that Japanese society does not value cleanliness more than Western societies. It certainly does. If New York City banned public trash cans, they city streets would be filled with garbage. We <em>do</em> have trash cans, and they already are. It does make me wonder who leaves trash in the parks and rivers because I could never dream of doing that, and I can&#39;t imagine my friends would either.</p>
    <p>But how do we end up in a scenario where I am holding a slimy wet piece of trash and asking a janitor who is holding a garbage bag &mdash; which not coincidentally is why my watch box is slimly and wet&mdash; and that janitor is telling me to keep it.</p>
    <p>Is that really a better system? Yeah, I suppose it is. The results speak for themselves. </p>

<div class="para-tex">

<p>King Charles said in his younger and more forthright years, "You have to give this much to the Luftwaffe — when it knocked down our buildings, it didn’t replace them with anything more offensive than rubble". I wonder if there ever was an equivalent statement made about us by the Japanese.</p>
<p>Tokyo is a city looking for a soul. No one section is particularly pretty. Or even particularly unique. It strikes me as a little odd that a country so insular and hostile to foreign influence has it&#39;s entire urban fabric is built in an international style. There is nothing particular <em>Japanese</em> about Tokyo. You can take any building for Tokyo&#39;s skyline and plop it in any other city without much question.  I challenge a naive guesser to think of three Tokyo landmarks. I can barely do that after spending a week there.</p>
<p>It&#39;s easy to find the blame. 50% of Tokyo was leveled in World War II, and much like post-war American cities, it struggles to build any sense of identity out of the rubble.</p>
<p>That&#39;s not to say that it isn&#39;t charming, but it is a city built to optimize function at the cost of form. The Japanese might even tell you that this is to their taste. While the West eats rolled sushi, they prefer the nigiri. A delicate piece of fish on top of a perfectly formed cylinder of rice is beauty through simplicity&mdash; no need for avocado, spicy mayo, or cream cheese. Remove everything nonessential and you are left with the pure essence. Life without distractions. The zen mindset. What&#39;s more Japanese than that?</p>
<p>I almost believed that until I saw the clutter of Shinjuku or the grand roofs of Kyoto. I believe it&#39;s more simple than that: Tokyo is a city that was looking to catch up. The American bombing raids completely unraveled the country&#39;s urban fabric and, in two cases, reduced entire cities to ashes. The destruction of Japan is unmatched anywhere else on the earth.  </p>
<p>Most societies would have shriveled up and died faced with such destruction. Japan rose to its economic and perhaps even cultural height.</p>
<p>In the day, perhaps Tokyo is bland. But at night, the city glows. In Shinjuku and Shibuya especially, half a million neon kanji bath the city in a rainbow glow, all the more intoxicating since you don&#39;t know what any of it means. It&#39;s a sprawling Times Square with the grit of the 70&#39;s. Block after block of girl shops, and women in maid outfits line the streets. Bouncer stand on each corner, beckoning you into strip clubs and pachinko palaces. </p>
<p>Ramen, sushi and tempura spots stack on top of each other in a chaotic cacophony of culinary possibility. Department and electronic stores rises five stories each. The knick knack emporium, Don Quixote, gives the impression of a franchised flea market. And it is all swarming with relentless crowds of people. Japanese business men march lockstep in black suits through the subway gates, constantly pinging with the taps of suica cards. </p>
<p>By any major transit hub, you can hardly wait at a cross walk unengulfed by hundreds of fellow pedestrians. It&#39;s impossible to imagine that such a place is in the midst of history&#39;s greatest population crunch.</p>
<p>It&#39;s a Jeckle and Hyde city&mdash; a bit subdued during the day, and simply fantastic at night. </p>

        <span class="border">Kyoto</span>
    </div>
</div>

<div class="para-tex">
<p>Kyoto is the polar opposite of Tokyo. Tokyo is new, neon, fast moving, and not just a little bit ugly. Kyoto is old, made from hewn wood and ancient tile. Tokyo is a city of shops, and Kyoto is a city of temples. Walking through Gion is a trip back in time. The urban fabric is thickly populated with creaking old Edo homes and shops, each with steep twirling roofs, decorated with dark grey tiles, white walls, and thick dark wood supports. </p>
<p>There is certain humbleness to Japanese architecture. There are no grand temples, rising a hundred or so feet into the air, no plazas surrounded by museums. And curiously, no statues at all. I believe I spotted one in Tokyo. He was a martial figure, riding atop a fearsome horse, but I suspect he was from the Meiji restoration back when Japan was rabidly trying to shed its cultural past and westernize. </p>
<p>But in Kyoto, there is no statues&mdash; except of course of buddha. Even the great temples of Kyoto feel small in scale compared to Europe. Western architecture, at its best, instills a sense of wonder in its citizens, a sense timeless grandeur, causing one to marvel at the fact that <em>your</em> ancestors were able to build something so beautiful, ornate, and grand.   </p>
<p>Kyoto tells a different story. The temples here are smaller in scale but perhaps purposefully so. Instead their beauty comes from their craftsmanship, their setting, and their <em>wabi</em>. </p>
<p>The word <em>wabi</em> roughly translates to worn or humble. But in Japanese culture, it seems to encapsulate a belief in the dignity of simplicity. The interior of Edo homes are kept clean and nearly empty, not because the Japanese lack physical possessions but because all of that is kept in the kura. Similarly, temples do not need to be giant ostentatious affairs, when something a bit smaller might do. </p>
<p>Alex Kerr has a more pessimistic view in his book, &quot;Lost Japan&quot;:</p>
<blockquote><p>Poverty-stricken kuge nobles and middle-class shopkeepers used wabi as a weapon to establish their cultural superiority. It was a form of deceit, carried to the level of art. A crudely fashioned brown tea bowl was held up as superior to the most elaborately decorated Imari platter, and nobody ever dared to ask why</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Perhaps, it is true that the newly dispossessed nobles invented a new way to be superior to peasants after the shoguns wrestled control from them and moved the capital to Kamakura. But Kerr&#39;s analysis of the Japanese cultural development is a bit too jaded. It&#39;s hard to look at the gold plated temple of Kinkaku-ji  and think this was an exercise in modesty, much less poverty masquerading as taste. </p>
<p>But Kinkaku-ji, despite its gold plated exterior, still maintains focus on a rustic charm. You do not need to crane your neck to get a view of it. There is no grand statue of its builder, or depictions of any gods or angels. It sits at the edge of a serene lake, nestled between gardens and manicured foothills. Much the same can be said of Tenryū-ji, a larger complex hidden in a bamboo forest at the base of a great mountain. </p>
<p>Perhaps <em>wabi</em> then is a closer to the western concept of the platonic ideal. Boil down a temple to the bare components that make a temple grand, adding as a little as possible so that the focus never turns from its purpose. Or perhaps, <em>wabi</em> is a bit like an English garden, where man-made structures are meant to accentuate nature rather than dominate it. </p>
<p>In this way, Kyoto is the <em>wabi</em> city. The temples accentuate their natural surroundings, and the urban fabric harmonizes within itself. It&#39;s grand in its simplicity. It feels both ostentatious and humble all at once. The sense of grandeur normally imbued when visiting a temple is replaced with a sense of peace. </p>

<p><em>Step 1: Carefully remove the lid from the natsume and place said lid upright on the tatami mat.</em> </p>
<p>Our host patiently but oddly firmly explained the steps of the tea ceremony to us. She was a psychologist who used the intricate nature of the tea ceremony to impart mindfulness on her patients. </p>
<p><em>Step 2: Using the chashaku, a thin lacquered wood scoop, draw two scoops of matcha from the natsume, and deposit them into the chawan. Tap the inside of the chawan to free any excess matcha from the chashaku</em></p>
<p>I can see the mindfulness in the ritual. We sat inside her tea room in a beautiful grand house on the outskirts of Kyoto. The gentle rain peppered against the wooden roof. Only a thin paper screen separated us from her garden.</p>
<p><em>Step 3: Return the lid to the natsume and place the chashaku across the top, ensuring that it never touches the ground</em></p>
<p>Japanese society was once highly ritualized, with strict social customs dictating many interactions. The tea ceremony is perhaps the most famous. And though it appeared highly choreographed to us, we participated in the informal Chakai version, lasting only 45 minutes, compared to the Chaji, which can only be accomplished by senior tea masters and which lasts up to four hours.</p>
<p><em>Step 4: Use the hishaku, a bamboo ladle with a long stem, to retrieve a scoop of boiling water from the Kama, and deposit 80% of it into the chawan. Bring the hishaku to rest atop the Kama.</em></p>
<p>Perhaps the same impulse drives the &quot;kata&quot; in karate. These are complicated routines or sequences of moves meant to respond to a given scenario. Each movement in the kata is preordained. Every movement of the hand, arms, body and legs is mapped and to be performed in a given order. There is no thinking in karate, or at least there shouldn&#39;t be. A fight is a set of flows, movements, and manners, and with strict diligence and concentration, each path could be memorized and responded to, an act closer to a ritual or dance than a fight. </p>
<p>Likewise, each interaction, each utensil&#39;s position, every word and movement is ritualized into a set of complex kata for the tea ceremony. The Teishu, or tea host, and the kyaku, or guest, each have a dictated role to play and must bring mindfulness and flow into the highly mannered practice of preparing and receiving matcha tea.</p>
<p><em>Step 5: Use the chasen to whisk the matcha, first in a figure-eight pattern and then back and forth, building the tea to a fine froth</em></p>
<p>The rituals are gone from Japan.</p>
<p>Do not expect a formal tea ceremony as a visitor in a Japanese home. No one knows the kata. The geisha is dwindling. Tea houses are drying up across the country. The rigid formality of Edo Japan is giving way to common society of a more global world. But this highly ritualized world left behind an unmatched set of manners in Japan.</p>
<p>Each interaction in Japan still follows a more formal script than in the western world. When you enter a restaurant in, you will be greeted with &quot;Irasshaimase!&quot;, and upon leaving the entire staff with undoubtedly say, &quot;Arigatou gozaimashita!&quot; It&#39;s not uncommon that a waiter will even walk you to the door and offer a deep bow as you exit.</p>
<p><em>Step 6: Place the chasen in front of the guest, and offer a deep bow</em></p>
<p>Manners are rituals. They are prescribed set of social kata meant to demonstrate consideration for the stranger. The waiter brings the check and asks how the meal was. I tell him it was great, lying if need be. He hands me the check. I tip 20%, absent any grave violation of politeness. Each step in this ritual, a moment of mindfulness, an exercise in receiving and giving dignity to a stranger. The waiter asks how the meal was, not because he particularly cares, but because it&#39;s the expectation that he would ask.  </p>
<p>And so we complete our little tea ceremony.</p>

<div class="para-tex">
<p>I was in the inner garden of the Kennin-ji Temple. It was our first day in Kyoto, and we were walking around the Gion district when we had happened upon this place. It wasn&#39;t a widely suggested stop, but the bend of its mighty roof stood out as the first potential landmark in the area, so we wandered in.</p>
<p>We were directed to take off our shoes and to be quiet and respectful since this was a holy place. We could take photos of the garden but not of the interior, and especially not of the monks who practiced there. In Japan there are two types of holy spaces&mdash; shinto shrines and zen buddhist temples. Shinto shrines tend to be outdoors, and the shrine itself is said to hold a kami, something akin to a forest spirit. The Grand Shrine of Ise is said to hold <em>Amaterasu-Ōmikami</em> as well as mirror that was used to trap her, after she went into hiding. </p>
<p>Zen Buddhism, an import from India by way of China, in contrast, typically both has an indoor and outdoor space. The indoor space is typically plain rooms, containing sliding paper doors and mats to sit on. They often overlook an outdoor space, in our case, a zen garden, with crushed grey rocks raked into swirling patterns around a collection of stones. </p>
<p>The objective is to stare at these stones and empty your mind. It&#39;s a practice, and one that I am not very good at.</p>
<p>It was here that I asked myself, &quot;why I cannot find my own peace?&quot; The Japanese might respond that I have never really tried. </p>
<p>I have often thought of my neurotic impulses as spasms of an overworked overseer. My brain is constantly scanning both the environment and my body, constantly looking for ways to maintain homeostasis, despite consciously knowing it will be a losing battle in the end. Does my stomach hurt? Did I eat the wrong thing? Is this burger killing my heart, is this soda destroying my pancreas?</p>
<p>My fears have been right before, and my neuroticism has helped in the past. But it has been wrong far more than it has been right. Sometimes my fears are like a bad weather man, calling everyday for rain and then gloating when it finally comes. </p>
<p>To the West, emptying your mind sounds like relaxing. But that is perhaps counter productive. It is an active pursuit, more akin to working out or playing a sport. In college, I learned of Tibetan monks who would balance a candle on their head, so that if their posture dropped or they fell asleep, the candle would fall and burn them. It&#39;s an active, physically challenging pursuit to find peace.</p>
<p>I sat there and looked at the stone. My thoughts went to my flight back through Newark. To my work at home. To past arguments and slights from strangers. And eventually just to a general sense of foreboding and edge.</p>
<p>A temple is an intentional place. You must remove your shoes. You bow when thanking the attendant. The stones were placed with great care. The crushed gravel is raked and re-raked to form a particular pattern. In such an intentional space, why do I have such trouble being intentional with my thoughts?</p>
<p>The Japanese know perhaps more than any other culture that taking it easy will not give you an easy life. There is a practice towards being peaceful. This practice is exercised in the form of ritual. Carefully pouring tea. Raking the zen garden. Even their excessive manners are a form of intentionality. </p>
<p>In slow back streets of Kyoto, it is easy to cultivate ritual and intentionality. But back home in New York, less so. The United States is easy going with manners and ritual. People will bump into you. A waiter or stewardess will snap with a snide remark. The doctors office will respond with a calculated indifference to your pain. It&#39;s harder here. It&#39;s a breeding ground for a neurotic overseer, on watch for bad interactions and uncomfortable social situations. But then perhaps, it is all the more important to build out these rituals, these moments of zen, so that my mind has a place to rest. </p>

<div class="para-tex">
    <p>&quot;I have question for you. Why are there so many foreigners?&quot;, our bartender asked as a fellow Japanese patron turned to look at me with a quizzical look on his face. She was right. There were quite a few foreigners, more than I or perhaps even the Japanese suspected there should and would be. </p>
    <p>We were in Golden Gai, a collection of back alley bars that was a bit unlike any place I had been before. It a twist of four alleys tucked behind the highly neoned Shinjuku. Each bar was no bigger than my Brooklyn kitchen, and featured no more than six or seven stools, and no room to stand. </p>
    <p>Shibuya had something similar, a small strip adjacent to train tracks, called Drunkard&#39;s Alley. One night Megan and I would accidentally stumble into a Japanese-only bar, to get a frosty reception, curt replies to attempts at conversation, and a big smile when we paid and left. </p>
    <p>But Golden Gai felt a bit magical. The bars were intimate. I had never once struck up a conversation with a bartender in the US, but here it almost felt like a requirement of the space. It was like stepping into a living room.</p>
    <p>At a different bar, the bartender offered us his grandmother homemade plumb wine, out of a sealed glass decanter, along with free shots of tequila and conversation about the three months he spent in Soho in New York City. We asked but in that entire time, he never left Manhattan, much less visited Brooklyn. </p>
    <p><em>Why so many foreigners?</em></p>
    <p>I thought about it. Tokyo had actually significantly less foreigners of any major international city that I have ever visited by a pretty remarkable margin. </p>
    <p>If you live in New York, you don&#39;t go to the Statue of Liberty, at least not routinely. So if you were to go, you would surrounded by tourists. Do locals go to Joe&#39;s? Do locals go to the Bethesda Fountain in Central Park. Do tourist expect they are getting the authentic New York experience when they do what the locals rarely do? What else can be expected of them? Should they spend their vacation at the DMV for the authenticity.</p>
    <p>Do locals go to Golden Gai? I don&#39;t know, but I imagine they will less as more foreigners come. </p>
    <p>But all this was past the possibilities of our conversation.</p>
    <p>&quot;For me, it&#39;s kind of like traffic. When I am in traffic, I always think who are all these people driving around? But I am the people. I am the traffic. Much the same way, I want to experience authentic Tokyo, but everywhere I go I see tourists. But I am the tourists.&quot;</p>
    <p>She nodded politely. I could tell that she thought I had taken offense at her comment, and hadn&#39;t understood my reply. I&#39;m not sure I fully understood my point either. I want Japan to feel Japanese but also want it to feel welcoming and accessible. Those two things are in tension with each other. The conversation dried up. Megan and I paid and left.  </p>
